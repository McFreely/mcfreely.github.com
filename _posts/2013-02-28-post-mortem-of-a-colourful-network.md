Color. The awesome and innovative social network that almost could have been but peaked before prime time. Too soon.
Putting aside internal dramas and rumors, I'd like to understand it more and decrypt the reasons of its failure.


### Description

The Basic idea of Color is of a fluid social network. Whereas in others (Twitter, Facebook, ...), the communication between two persons is pre-approved before further exchanges, Color was different.
The concept was turned on its head. The app was a rahter normal camera app, with a social layer on top. Instead of sharing the photos you took with your friends, the app, by being location-aware (plus other nifty algos, a given now, but not so much two years ago), would transmit them on the location of the shoot.
Let me give you an example for clarification. Imagine that you and a couple of friends go to a bar on a weekday. You took a few photos. Now everyone in the bar, and only them, could access the photos. And you could access photos taken by other people in the bar on that same night.
The concept of friends or followers in that network was inexistant, some would even say irrelevant.

### Philosophy

I like to call it a fluid network. It was not bound by pre-approval but by actions and interactions happening in real time (and real life).

The idea was to share moments not with your traditional friends, but with the people there, physically with you. That was really innovative, in a space were sharing and social aspects are rather conservative.
To rediscover events throught the point of view of unknown people was quite attractive to me. Live a moment and then relive it multiple time in multiple different ways. To find and appreiciate a perspective until now unavailable.

### The Fall

Despite a healthy news coverage during launch, it never really took off. The interface innovations were on par with the core concept. A lot of people couldn't really understand the purpose of the way to work it properly.
That was the death sentence right here and there. If nobody uses your app, especially a social app, it will never gain traction. Chicken and egg problem.

The second, underlying problem, IMHO, was its subject: photos are too intimate and personnal to share with strangers. You don't go around in the street showing the photos of your last night party to every person you happen to meet.
But While it was too intimate, the concepts of a fluid network are still sounds. It may well be applied to others domains more apt to sharing without friction. Because the major flaw of Color was friction.
