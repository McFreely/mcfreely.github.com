When the time machine will be invented, and it will be, in a few years or in 1882, it won't be quite what we expect.

It will crush people in a way they don't, they won't, anticipate.
Time travel will be an irrefutable proof that times of past weren't better. Life wasn't easier or smoother or even simpler.

It was just the same life as today. It'll always be the same life.
This thought could drastically change a nostalgic mind. The possibility of a better future, or rather the impossibility of a dream inspired by the decades before it. An utopia shattered in seconds.

Incidentely, and paradoxically, time travel will have been invented, but that's just a little detailâ€¦

Or it could be the revelation that there was no doom in sight, no values destruction, no discernable change from one generation to the next. Life is and Life will be, whatever happen to us.
