<p>Who doesn't struggle with time management? I think that it is a pretty common battle, especially for us developers out there. Every day is tackled with the best of intentions: I am going to learn this, I am going to program that, I am going to blog about this, etc...</p>

<p>The problem is that our focus is very fractured this way. When you set out to do something with no real goal in mind, you tend to set out with very little focus. As each day comes to a close, time becomes the enemy because there is just never enough of it.</p>

<p>For me, the way to remedy the situation is to throw software at it. Set up massive projects with milestones, tasks, and timers that you can click stop and start on. This is good to see what is on the table, but this can be a little daunting, and it still doesn't address the core issue.</p>

<p>The difficulty stems from the fact that we as human beings are quick to go down rabbit holes. Our minds wander. I can't even think of how many times I have sat down ready to read, program, blog, and have just wandered off into something completely different than what I originally intended to do.</p>

<h2>An honest look at my typical approach</h2>
<p>This is probably a little more honest than most of us young professionals care to be, but this is how a typical task for me goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sit down to work</li>
<li>Open up my text editor</li>
<li>Open up last.fm and start searching for some music I want to listen to</li>
<li>Start writing some code</li>
<li>Don't like the song that is playing so I need to flip through several to get to one I like</li>
<li>Start writing some code again</li>
<li>Been a while since I checked Facebook and Twitter....better do that</li>
<li>Code a little more</li>
<li>Remember that other cool thing I started earlier in the week and revisit that</li>
<li>Email notification pops up so I better read that</li>
<li>Code a little more</li>
<li>Favorite TV show is on...so I have to watch that</li>
<li>Call it a night and go to bed</li>
</ol>

<p>Well that's embarrassing.... not really a whole lot of actual work getting done.</p>

<h2>Pomodoro Technique to the rescue!</h2>
<p>The Pomodoro (that is Italian for tomato btw) Technique is a technique that was invented by <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/about.html" title="About Pomodoro Technique" target="_blank">Francesco Cirillo</a>. The tagline from the book <a href="http://pomodoro-book.com/" title="pomodoro technique illustrated" target="_blank">Pomodoro Technique Illustrated</a> by Staffan NÃ¶teberg says it all: "The easy way to do more in less time." I had my first crash course in this today with my good friend Bryce Darling. I am still new to it, but here is what I have taken away from it:</p>

<h3>Create an "Activity Inventory"</h3>
<p>Make a list of what needs to be done. It does not have to be that complicated - think about what needs to be done and write it down (yes on a piece of paper).</p>

<h3>Create a "To Do Today" list</h3>
<p>Take some items you feel confident about doing off of your activity inventory, and make a list out of them. These should be items you feel confident about completing for the day.</p>

<h3>Set a timer and go!</h3>
<p>Set a timer for 25 minutes. Work while the timer is ticking down. Ignore those emails, texts, the playlist, that tv show.... and just work. When the timer beeps, take a break!</p>

<p>Today was my first time taking a stab at this, but I was immediately surprised by how productive I was. I was able to complete two page designs in Photoshop in 4 Pomodori (that is 4 25 minute sprints of work). This is possible because the time is extremely focused.</p>

<p>While that timer is ticking, you aren't doing anything but working. When the timer is up, you reward yourself with 5, 10, or 15 minutes of a break. Use that time to check the emails, or set up the playlist. Detach yourself from the work completely. Don't think about what you just did, or what you are going to do next. Just relax.</p>

<h2>What I took away from it</h2>
<p>I will definitely be reading more from <a href="http://pomodoro-book.com/" title="pomodoro technique illustrated" target="_blank">Pomodoro Technique Illustrated</a>, but I see some immediate benefits.</p> 
<h3>1. Increased productivity.</h3>
<p>I saw this evidenced today. I was amazed by how much I was able to get done in such a short period of time.</p>
<h3>2. Less anxiety.</h3>
<p>By detaching and taking a break for a little bit after each Pomodori, you will decrease your anxiety about the work at hand, and give your brain a chance to run some background threads on what it just did while you sip a coffee, call a friend, or just hang out.</p>
<h3>3. Ability to assess what you have done.</h3>
<p>It was nice being able to log 75 minutes for a task. This gave me a greater sense of how much time it actually takes to do work. This will have an immense pay off in estimating and boxing off time in the future.</p>

<p>There is still a lot to learn, but so far I am sold on this amazing technique for managing time and getting work done!</p>
