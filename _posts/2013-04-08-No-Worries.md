# No Worries

The method is simple: if i can't have any control on the thing that worry me,
i'm not allowed to worry about it. It's not necessary, simple as that.

In the majority of cases, it's either of two sort of worry.

## The Uncertain

If the thing is already done or has yet to happen, i do not worry.
Let's descontruct it even more. The basic idea is that i can't control time.
At least not yet.
If it's already done, there is absolutely no possibility for me to change it
whatsoever. Yes, that big meeting was important, and i made a few mistakes. But wasting time worrying about the possible ooutcomes is neither practical nor healthy.
If it has yet to happen, worrying in advance has the same effect. Now, i'm not a fool, i will prepare myself. But, then again, worrying about what might be or happen is not really productive. Yes, I have a big deadline coming up soon, but getting anxious about it will not make things easier. All I can do is produce my best work and see how things go.

If you worry or get anxious in those situation, it's not only unproductive, it's toxic. It's toxic because anxiety compound. The more worry you are, the more you will be.

## The Immutable

It's almost the same but with a twist. You're not an actor in the situation, just a spectator. When an event totally out of your control happens, anxiety only comes in your way and paralyse you.
Whether it's the unavoidable death of a loved one, or getting rejected by a girl way out of your league, you're not a god. You can't control everything and everyone around you. This worry is even more insidious because by paralysing you, you start to only think of event. Muling it over and over in your head, until it's the only item remaining in it.

## Conclusion

What i'm trying to say is relax and enjoy the (bumpy) ride. Learn to let go (link to buddhism text). Baby steps by baby steps.
