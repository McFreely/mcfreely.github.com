<!-- Title: Is Agile Dead? -->
<h2>Why Ask?</h2>
<p>
	I recently had the good pleasure of attending <a href="http://kalamazoox.org/" target="_blank">The Kalamazoo X Conference</a>. It's a cool little conference designed to give developers and designers a chance to focus on soft skills - that is interacting with people, communicating, standing out, etc.. 
</p>
<p>
	It was <a href="http://about.me/leongersing" target="_blank">Leon Gersing</a> that had quite a lot to say on the dominant culture's impact on trends. He had a lot of fun stuff to say about tripping on LSD while programming, failing with joy, and determining your end goal - which for many of us is making software. Leon said one thing that struck a chord with me:
</p>
<blockquote class="superquote">
	<p>
		Agile is dead.
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Coming from a web warrior like Leon, I have to at least consider it.
</p>
<hr />
<h2>Why Is It Dead?</h2>
<p>
	Leon made the point that most people doing Agile today are actually doing Waterfall with Agile terms. That is the dominant culture of Waterfall fan boys has assumed Agile, but has really made it something new.
</p>
<p>
	Doing .NET development, I have seen my fair share of psuedo scrummers, and agile wannabes. Or people who just don't care. Hearing that Waterfall statement resonated with me, because I have seen it happen.
</p>
<p>
	The bottom line matters in business, and I think there are many "big business" types that like the idea of agile, but they like the idea of tons of documentation, and tons of process better. I have a hard time saying Agile is dead, because I am on the front lines constantly fighting for more Agile practices. Less process, better developer/customer interaction, and more working software! These are good things!
</p>
<blockquote class="superquote">
	<p>
		Less process, better developer/customer interaction, and more working software!
	</p>

<hr />
<h2>There Is Hope</h2>
<p>
	I refuse to believe Agile is dead. Watching true wizards like Uncle Bob still do their thing is encouraging. It's plain beautiful to hear guys like this talk about code. Take a waltz down to Uncle Bob's <a href="http://www.cleancoders.com/codecast/clean-code-episode-10/show" target="_blank">Clean Coders</a> site and see how he lives the dream!
</p>
<p>
	I see it all the time where Agile can still be used to meet the end goal of delivering software. Thats what we do. Thats what we should aim to do. The agile manifesto is getting older, but I think it is still relevant:
</p>
<blockquote class="superquote">
	<p>
		<strong>Individuals and interactions</strong> over processes and tools<br>
		<strong>Working software</strong> over comprehensive documentation<br>
		<strong>Customer collaboration</strong> over contract negotiation<br>
		<strong>Responding to change</strong> over following a plan<br><br>

		That is, while there is value in the items on<br>
		the right, we value the items on the left more.
	</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
	I hope to see an attitude and environment that brings new life into this manifesto. I don't think Agile is dead, but it is being suffocated.
