I have a love-hate relationship with social networks. I hate them for the obvious reasons. They're a bit pointless, some would even say useless. They are
"closed gardens" : I can control the way the information is displayed to me. They use my personnal date for commercial endeavours.
At the same time, I love them. The socialogical aspect is fascinating to no end. We can do all sort of crazy stuff with their various APIs.
I wanted for a long time now write an in-depth article(s) of the diverse social networks that exist today, and their inherent limitations.
This is a subject that interest me for a long time (since my facebook registration in 2007 I think). Thinking about it over the years lead me to beleive
that they are far from perfect (breaking news!), but also that something might be done to steer them in the right direction. I'll firstly paint a broad picture
of the current concurrents in the field today. I will then analyse what they really are and how they are articulated. the I'll expand on a few ideas that
I have about the future of Social Networks.
This will most likely be a series of articles rather than a one-shot, essentially because i have a lot to say, but also
because of the vast realm we will explore together.

But first we must list the suspect of our investigation, and catecorize them for more clarity.

## A view of the land

We can order Social Networks (SN) in three broad categories:
   - The top tier: Pure social Networks
   - The second-tier : Those built uppon the first
   - The Weird ones : The more experimental ones

### The Pure social Networks

Those are obvious : Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc...
They are what i like to call "Pure" SNs because the almost replicate the way we would interact in real life. You add people you often already know,
you exchange messages and invitations.
They were built with the idea of a social network for the ground up,to merley enhance the normal social interactions you already have.
Facebook allows us to communicate with people almost like we would communicate in real life, with the added "benefit" of likes.
Twitter allows us to follow the (rarely funny) stream of thoughts of people we like.

They have an invisible drawback : you rarely communicate or interact with people you don't know.
For SNs to tout "bringing people closer", it's quite ironic.

### The Leeches

The second-tier of SNs are built upon the first one. These are the SNs that uses you're already existing Social Graph
to offer you a myriad of services or recommandations relevant to you.
A few of them comes to mind : Prismatic (news recommandation), Flixster (movie recommandations) [A completer]

While they might offer a good service on paper, their weakness lies in their apparent force.
They assume that my social graphs or my facebook likes are good data points for furure recommandations.

### The Outcasts

The weirdos, the neglected, the ill-loved.
The one that stand from all the others is COLOR.
Besides all the management stories and internal conflicts (those are not the point), I think the original concept was quite interresting.
The idea of a fluid SN was, and still is for me, an attractive idea. Saddly, it was too soon for the world to accept it.


## To be continued

In the next articles, I will go further in-depth for each categories, providing more precise examples and analysis.
