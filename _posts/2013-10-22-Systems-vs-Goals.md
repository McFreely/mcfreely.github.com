After reading the very good article by Dilbert's creator {name} on {site}, I try to make sense of his principle
of being more system oriented than Goal oriented. You can feel the wisdom in his quote and in the sparse examples illustrating it. But to really understand it and assimilate it is an whole other story. I scratched my head for a long while, like many on this hackernews discussion {link}. I wanted to try and explore this concept more, and by
proxy, continue the discusion further. I feel there is something strongly begging to be discovered in this little nugget. _His book comming in the next weeks might cast some light on this_

First the quote in question.

##Possible Applications
as far as i can see there is multiple domain where this is applicable, and in-depth examples are moreexplicative
than a rather terse theorical analysis.

### Fitness
We all want to be fitter and better looking and live much longer. In our quest to Superman and WonderWoman levels of body appearance, it's common, if not the only way, to come up first with a _goal_. For example, to lose a few dozen pounds or to be able to run a marathon in six month time.
These are all commendable goals to attain. I myself am trying to gain a couple of stones (i'm skinny). Looking at these objectives throught the prism of Goals seem attractive. A lot of us say to themselves that if we can attain the promised goal, our life will be for the better. And it's undeniable.

This is where, it seems to {author}, is the trap. The trap is that once you attain the long sought goal, you tend to slack off. You tell to yourself that it's okay to take a week off to celebrate, and then another one. Until you get back in your old ways.

The system approach would be to develop habbits in your preexisting routine (commonly called your life), without an obsessed eyes to final result, merely a direction, a _cap_. Changing your routine incrementally will get you to your objectives easily, more easily than just with a Goal on a calendar.

The foremost advantage is that you can add a lot of differents litle things more and more each week, rather than a drastic change come january first. Things like taking hte stairs rather the lift in the first week. Then walk a for a few block each day, in the second week, etc... Your not developping yourself to get in better shape. You're developping a better system. It would seem that focusing on a system allow more flexibility.

### Business / Profesionnal Carreer

While it looks easy enough for a fitness objective, it gets more complicated for anything business related.Ã©
