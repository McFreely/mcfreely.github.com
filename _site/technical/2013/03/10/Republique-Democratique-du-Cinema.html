	<p>My new project. A really democratic movie review website. How does one achieve this? Why, with sentiment analysis of tweets. This is the first post in a long series, an introduction if you will.</p>

<h3 id='the_inception'>The inception</h3>

<p>I wanted to play for a long time with Natural Language Processing (NLP) for a few reasons. First, because it&#8217;s cool. Being a litterature geek, when i can combine code and prose, it&#8217;s more than a pleasure. Second, while working on a few projects in pre-production (meaning: in a sketchbook), I realized that a lot of the underlying tchniques needed were often coming back to NLP. One of them being Sentiment Analysis. Sentiment analysis is practical. It is hands on application of NLP theories.</p>

<p>At the same time, I observed the cruel lack of good movies reviews sites in french. Except for a subpar and ads-ridden &#8220;imdb&#8221;, there is not a lot. No RottenTomatoes (RT), no Flixster, no nothing. So the idea to create something akin to RT came to mind, but with a spin. The reviews would not come from established professional critics but from average people. You, me and everybody else.</p>

<h3 id='why_do_it_it_already_exists_'>Why do it, It already exists !</h3>

<p>I am aware that such concepts have already been tested and approved, to various level of success. I want to do it for two reasons. First, because as I previously mentionned, it doesn&#8217;t really exists in french, not that I know of. Second, it will be a good learning opportunity on several aspects. The algorithmic aspect, but also the DevOps aspect.</p>

<p>After reading a discusion about AWS on HackerNews, I realized that the project could not only be decoupled in code but also in infrastructure. I will therefore try to write a couple articles about that solution, and how everything is working, both for the code and for the servers.</p>

<h3 id='the_project_plan'>The Project Plan</h3>

<p>I will explain in a more in-depth fashion the &#8220;architecture&#8221; of the project in a future post. But for now, I&#8217;ll just explain the broad view.</p>

<p>So, the idea is to take tweets about a movie, aggregate them, analyse them with a sentiment analysis algorithm, put them in a database, complete them with classic infos about them (poster, year, &#8230;) and finally dipslay the results to the audience. That&#8217;s it for the basic concept.</p>

<p>I want to ultimately streamline everything and make it entirely automatic if possible. I&#8217;m not there yet.</p>

<p>I am currently working on the MVP, after many nights of pondering of how to do it. I decided that if I continued to ponder on various little details, it will never be done. So yes, it is rudimentary at the moment. It&#8217;s mostly a proof of concept. You can check the advancement on github, everything starting with &#8220;RDC&#8221;.</p>

<p>Sorry if this is not really a technical post, but it&#8217;s more suited here. In the next posts, i will explain furthermore, in no particular order: the detailed &#8220;architecture&#8221; of the project, the different parts of AWS, the possible algos for the analysis, how everything work together&#8230;</p>
