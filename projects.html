    <h3>République Démocratique du Cinéma</h3>
    <p class="small_text">My current project. A sentiment analysis app. The idea is to aggregate tweets about a movie, analyse them and finally display the results for all to see. In "real-time (tm)".
    </p>
    <p class="small_text">You can learn more about that project by reading the articles on my blog (the ones beging with 'RDC-')</p>

    <h3>MovieList</h3>
    <p class="small_text">A simple app to manage a list of movie to watch.</p>
    <p class="small_text">The concept is simple, but I tried to make a really good UI/UX.</p>
    <p class="small_text">And it's responsive, Y'all!</p>
