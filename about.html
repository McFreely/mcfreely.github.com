  <p>Paul. 22. Coder by Day, Coder by night</p>
  <p>Ok, maybe not all the time. I have other passions. But programmation and developping various applications might be the first.</p>

  <p>I focus primaraly on creating web apps for various clients, and sometimes for myself. I work on all the stack, trying my best day after day to produce high quality results.<p>

  <p>I do this for almost five years now, and I still love it.</p>
  <p>I regularly use : Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, HTML5, Sass, JavaScript, Git and Emacs. </p>
  <p>You can see some of my projects <a href="/projects.html">here</a>.</p>
  <p>If you want to contact me for one of your projects, you can contact me to this address: paulmcfreely @ gmail . com</p>

  <h3>Why "McFreely" ?</h3> <p>This is evidently not my real name. But Trying to carve a place for yourself on Internet when your name is the french equivalent of "John Smith" is not easy...</p>
